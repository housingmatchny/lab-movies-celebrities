order of steps

routes - create celebrities.js
var celebritiesRouter
app.use to tell the program when to use the router
models > celebrity.js: define the model

views - new celebrity: added form


4 main files for movement:
model - define model
view - define layout; take the schema and insert
layout - link the path 
route - set the route to render from xx
